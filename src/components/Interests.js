      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p> I have a deep passion for traveling, as it gives me the chance to explore new cultures <br/> and experience different ways of life. I also love reading, whether it’s fiction, non-fiction, or anything <br/> that broadens my perspective. Learning is something I’m always excited about, <br/> whether it’s picking up new skills or diving into a subject that intrigues me. <br/> Music plays a big role in my life as well—it helps me relax and inspires me creatively. <br/> Altogether, these interests keep me curious and always growing.</p>
